# Factory Methods in Dart

A factory method is a special constructor (made with the factory keyword).
It helps you check or control how an object is created.
If something’s wrong, it can return a default object instead of failing.



## ✅ Summary

- factory lets you add logic before creating an object.

- Here, it prevents invalid names and returns a default object when needed.

- We directly call and print without using variables.

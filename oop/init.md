# OOP in Dart 🎩💻

Welcome to the magical world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! ✨ It’s all about designing apps using objects—whether it's a person 🧍‍♂️, a car 🚗, or even a bank account 🏦. In OOP, objects have their own attributes (like name, color, or age) and behaviors (like walking, talking, or driving). Cool, right?

OOP isn’t just some fancy concept—it’s one of the most popular programming paradigms out there, used in Dart, Java, Python, and more! 🌎

## Why OOP is Awesome! 🤩

- 🧠 Easy to understand and use—no rocket science here!

- 🔁 Reusability FTW—code once, use it again and again!

- ⚙️ Less complex—because no one likes headaches. 😅

- 📈 Boosts productivity—get more done in less time!

- 👥 Teamwork-friendly—collaborate like a pro!

- 🛠️ Easier to maintain—fix bugs without breaking everything. 🐞

## Features of OOP 💡

- Class 📚: A blueprint for creating objects (like a recipe for cookies 🍪).

- Object 🎯: The actual instance created from the class (like a cookie 🍪 made from the recipe).

- Encapsulation 🛡️: Wrapping code into neat little packages.

- Inheritance 👨‍👧: Reusing properties from another class. (Dogs inherit from Animals 🐶🐾)

- Polymorphism 🎭: One method, many forms!

- Abstraction 💼: Only showing the essential features.

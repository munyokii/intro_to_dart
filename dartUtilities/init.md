# What Are Utilities?

`Utilities` are built-in helpers in Dart that simplify everyday tasks.
They don’t build your app’s structure — instead, they make your app’s logic easier to manage.
Think of them as small tools in a toolbox that make your work faster and cleaner.

Common Dart utilities include:

- `Date and Time` — to work with dates, times, and durations

- `Asynchronous Programming` — to handle tasks that take time without freezing the app

- `Enums` — to define a fixed list of possible options

## Date and Time Utility

This utility helps you get, format, and manipulate dates and times easily.
It’s useful when you need to show timestamps (like messages, deadlines, or events).

### Explanation

Dart’s DateTime class gives access to the current time, lets you add or subtract durations, and compare times.
The Duration class helps specify time intervals like hours, minutes, or days.

### Utility in Action

Used for:

- Showing when a message was sent

- Scheduling events or reminders

- Calculating how long something took
